# SVTM_Passivity_Enforcement
# Passivity Enforcement ### Author: Brian Guiana ### Date: 5/14/2021  This code was written for a class project in the course entitled ECE 504: "ST: Passive Electromagnetic Systems" taught in Spring 2021 by Dr. Ata Zadehgol at the University of Idaho in Moscow.   This code was developed, in part, based on the code developed by Jennifer Houle in ECE 504 "ST: Modern Circuit Synthesis Algorithms" taught in Spring 2020 by Dr. Ata Zadehgol. Jennifer's code is available online at https://github.com/JenniferEHoule/Circuit_Synthesis.   # Overview - This code implements the passivity enforcement algorithm detailed in [11] - This code uses programs written in [12] in order to get a vector fit state-space model to enforce passivity onto - This code was intended to be able to replace the file RPdriver.py in [12] for passivity enforcement  # Licensing From [7], restrictions on use, in addition to licensing:  >- Embedding any of (or parts from) the routines of the Matrix Fitting Toolbox in a commercial software, or a software requiring licensing, is strictly prohibited. This applies to all routines, see Section 2.1. >- If the code is used in a scientific work, then reference should me made as follows: >  - VFdriver.m and/or vectfit3.m: References [1],[2],[3] >  - RPdriver.m and/or FRPY.m applied to Y-parameters: [8],[9]  # Files ## Primary Files, [12] was the original creator of each associated file. - create_netlist.py [12] - passivity_driver.py [11] - plots.py [12] - utils.py [12] - vectfit3.py [12] - VFdriver.py [12]  ## Secondary Files - ex4_Y.py: 4-port example file - input_4_port_ads.s4p: Input for ex4_y.py - netlist.sp: Output for ex4_y.py  # Inputs - Singular .sNp file. Vector fitting is applied to this file followed by passivity enforcement  # Outputs - Singular .sp file. PSPICE simulation file for use with SPICE simulation software.  # References ``` [1] B.
